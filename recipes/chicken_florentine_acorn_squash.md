## Ingredients

- 1 acorn squash
- 15 ounces frozen kale
- 2 cups cooked chicken
- 1/2 onion
- 1/2 lemon
- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 2 1/4 cups chicken broth
- 1/3 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1 1/2 teaspoons arrowroot flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons water
- sea salt, to taste 

## Intructions

1. Preheat oven to 400F. Place acorn squash onto the oven grate whole and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until squash can be easily punctured with a fork. Allow to cool before handling.
2. Chop the chicken into 1 inch cubes. Finely mince onion. Zest and juice the lemon.
3. Heat olive oil in a pan over medium high heat. Add onion and saute until the onion begins to soften. Add garlic and saute for another 2 minutes.
4. Add broth and apple cider vinegar and mix to combine.
5. Dissolve arrowroot flour in water and slowly stir into the mixture. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer about 10 minutes or until you have a thick creamy sauce.
6. Remove sauce from heat once desired thickness has been reached and stir in the lemon zest and juice.
7. Slice squash in half. Use a large spoon to scoop out and discard the seeds and stringy center. The skin on acorn squash is edible, so itâ€™s your choice whether to leave it or remove it now. Chop squash into 1 inch cubes.
8. In a casserole dish, layer squash, chicken, and cooked kale. Add salt to taste. Pour sauce on top and serve hot.
