## Intructions

1. In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook linguine according to package directions until al dente. Set aside Â½ cup of pasta water, then drain pasta and set aside. 
2. In a small skillet cook the shrimp until they're tender.
3. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat oil. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute. Sprinkle flour over evenly, then stir and cook until mixture is lightly golden.
