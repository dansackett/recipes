## Intructions

### One day before

1. Combine the crushed garlic, salt, oregano, apple cider vinegar, and lemon
   juice in a small bowl.
2. Pat the pork shoulder dry with paper towels. Lay out several pieces of
   plastic wrap, overlapping (big enough to wrap the whole pork shoulder after
   the seasoning is rubbed on), and place the pork shoulder on top.
3. Rub the seasoning over the entire surface of the pork shoulder. Wrap tightly
   in the plastic wrap. Place in a dish or on a tray and refrigerate overnight.

### Day of cooking

1. Remove the pork shoulder from the refrigerator and let warm to room
   temperature for 1 hour before placing in the oven. Preheat the oven to
   275 degrees.
2. Remove the plastic wrap and place the pork on a roasting pan. Roast for 6
   hours, until the meat is fork-tender.
