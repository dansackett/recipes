| 5 Minutes | 15 Minutes |

## Ingredients

- 1 lbs Chicken breast, sliced into long strips
- 1 egg
- 1 cup shredded coconut
- 1/2 cup almond flour
- pinch sea salt
- coconut oil for greasing pan
- Dijon mustard (for dipping)

## Utilities

- Skillet
- Mixing bowls
- Cooling rack
- Baking sheet

## Intructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Cut chicken into long strips
3. In a shallow bowl, whisk egg. In another shallow bowl mix together coconut
   and flour and salt.
4. Dredge chicken strips in whisked egg then straight to coconut mixture. Coat
   on all sides then place on a plate. Repeat with all chicken strips.
5. Place coconut oil in a large pan over medium heat. Once the pan is hot, add
   the strips to the pan without crowding. Cook for 1 minute on each side to
   get a slight brown color. Do this in smaller batches to keep pan clean.
6. Place the strips on a cooling rack on top of a baking sheet. This helps cook
   both sides. Without the rack you would need to flip them halfway through.
7. Place sheet in oven and cook for 10 minutes or until they reach an internal
   temperature of 165 degrees.
8. Serve with a dipping dish of Dijon mustard.
