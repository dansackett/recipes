# Shepherd's Pie

I wanted to make some "home cooking" and discovered this great recipe. It is
incredibly good and even better with brown gravy over it.

## Timing

| Prep Time  | Cook Time  |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| 15 Minutes | 45 Minutes |

## Ingredients

### Filling

- 1 medium onion (diced)
- 2 cloves garlic (minced)
- 1 1/2 cups uncooked brown or green lentils (rinsed and drained)
- 4 cups vegetable stock (DIY or store-bought)
- 2 tsp fresh thyme (or sub 1 tsp dried thyme per 2 tsp fresh)
- 1 10-ounce bag frozen mixed veggies: peas, carrots, green beans, and corn

### Mashed Potatoes

- 3 pounds yukon gold potatoes, partially peeled (thoroughly washed)
- 3-4 Tbsp vegan butter
- Salt and pepper (to taste)

### Optional

- 2 Cooked chicken breasts. You don't need to add it but it makes the meal
  complete in my opinion.
- Brown gravy (simple from the store)

## Utilities

- Baking sheet
- Large pot for cooking potatoes
- Sauce pan
- 13x9 Baking dish

## Intructions

1. Slice any large potatoes in half, place in a large pot and fill with water
   until they’re just covered. Bring to a low boil on medium high heat, then
   generously salt, cover and cook for 20-30 minutes or until they slide off a
   knife very easily.
2. Once cooked, drain, add back to the pot to evaporate any remaining water,
   then transfer to a mixing bowl. Use a masher, pastry cutter or large fork to
   mash until smooth. Add add desired amount of vegan butter (2-4 Tbsp as
   original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), and season
   with salt and pepper to taste. Loosely cover and set aside.
3. While potatoes are cooking, preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C) and
   lightly grease a 2-quart baking dish (or comparable sized dish, such as 9x13
   pan. An 8x8 won’t fit it all but close! // as original recipe is written //
   adjust number or size of dish if altering batch size).
4. In a large saucepan over medium heat, sauté onions and garlic in 1 Tbsp
   olive oil (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch
   size) until lightly browned and caramelized - about 5 minutes.
5. Add a pinch each salt and pepper. Then add lentils, stock, and thyme and
   stir. Bring to a low boil. Then reduce heat to simmer. Continue cooking
   until lentils are tender (35-40 minutes).
6. In the last 10 minutes of cooking, add the frozen veggies, stir, and cover
   to meld the flavors together.
7. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.
8. In your baking dish, add a layer of chicken (optional), then transfer
   veggies and carefully top with mashed potatoes. Smooth down with a spoon or
   fork and season with another crack of pepper and a little sea salt.
9. Place on a baking sheet to catch overflow and bake for 10-15 minutes or
   until the mashers are lightly browned on top.
10. Let cool briefly before serving. The longer it sits, the more it will
    thicken. Let cool completely before covering, and then store in the fridge
    for up to a few days. Reheats well in the microwave.
