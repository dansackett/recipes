Good simple waffles.

## Timing

| Prep Time  | Cook Time  |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| 15 Minutes | 15 minutes |

## Ingredients

- 3 green plantains
- 1/2 cup coconut oil, plus more for greasing waffle iron
- 1 cup water
- 2 teaspoons gelatin
- 1 teaspoon sea salt
- 1/2 cup arrowroot
- pure maple syrup, to taste Chop the bacon into bite-sized pieces.

## Instructions

1. Peel and chop plantains. Melt coconut oil.
2. Place all ingredients in a high speed blender or food processor.
3. Turn on and push ingredients down with the tamper until it is uniform and smooth. If you need to add a bit more water, you can do so. You want the batter to be thick, but pourable.
4. Heat your waffle iron, coat with coconut oil, and cook per instructions. I sometimes let it go a little longer than the regular waffles as it can take a little longer to brown.
5. Serve immediately drizzled with a touch of maple syrup.
