## Intructions

### For donuts

1. Preheat mini donut maker.
2. In a bowl of a large food processor, combine the flours, sugars, baking
   soda, and salt. Pulse 30 times or until combined. Add the palm shortening,
   coconut milk, honey, vanilla, and almond extract.
3. In a medium-sized mixin bowl, combine cream of tartar and egg whites. Beat
   with a hand mixer set on high speed until soft peaks form. Add the beaten
   egg whites to the food processor and process until combined. Scrape down the
   sides as needed and process for another 30 seconds until a smooth and creamy
   cake batter has formed.
4. Using a rubber spatula, transfer the batter into a large resealable plastic
   bag and snip off a corner. Ssqueeze the batter evenly into the donut maker.
5. Cook for 2-3 minutes until all batter has been used in the donut maker.

### For chocolate

1. Put water in a small sauce pan and allow it to boil.
2. In a small glass mixing bowl, combine chocolate chips and ghee. Place bowl
   over sauce pan and allow the steam to slowly melt the chocolate.
3. Once fully melted, allow to cool.
4. Donuts can be dipped directly in the chocolate as you wish.
