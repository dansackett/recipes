## Instructions

1. Divide the cilantro in half. Peel and cut the red onion into large chunks. Peel and coarsely chop the carrots.
2. In a food processor with the s-blade, pulse red onion, garlic, cloves, salt, lime juice, apple cider vinegar, and 1/2 of the cilantro until smooth. Add water, if needed, to ensure that you have at least 1/2 cup of sauce.

6. When meat is done cooking, release quick-release pressure. Use two forks to shred the meat.
7. For the cauliflower rice: Chop the onion.
8. Heat the coconut oil in a skillet over medium heat. Sauté the onion and garlic for 3–4 minutes, or until the onion is translucent.
9. Add in the cauliflower rice and sauté for an additional 4–5 minutes. Season with salt.
10. Serve the beef on top of bowls of cauliflower rice with avocado, carrots, spinach, green onions, and remaining cilantro.
