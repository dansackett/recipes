## Ingredients
 
- 1 1/2 lbs chicken thighs
- 3 heads broccoli
- 1/2 inch fresh ginger
- 3 tablespoons coconut oil
- sea salt, to taste
- 5 teaspoons minced garlic
- 1/2 cup orange juice
- 1/2 cup coconut aminos
- 6 tablespoons water
- 1/4 cup honey

## Instructions

1. Chop chicken and broccoli. Grate ginger.
2. Add coconut oil to a skillet over medium-high heat. Season chicken with salt.  Working in batches as needed, add chicken to the pan and brown both sides.
3. Meanwhile, add garlic, orange juice, coconut aminos, water, honey, and ginger to a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Mix together, then bring to a boil.  Reduce heat to a simmer and let cook until sauce thickens.
4. In a separate pot, steam broccoli until just tender-crisp. Drain and set aside.
5. Once chicken is browned and the sauce has begun to thicken, pour sauce over the chicken and cook for 4-5 minutes, until chicken has cooked though.
6. Add broccoli to the chicken, and cook for another 1-2 minutes.
7. Remove from heat and serve!
