# Chocolate Avocado Smoothie

These smoothies are a great boost and don't taste like a typical green
smoothie.

## Timing

| Prep Time  | Cook Time  |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| 5 Minutes | 2 Minutes |

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups water
- 8 Medjool dates, pitted
- 1/2 avocado
- 2 tbsp cacao powder
- 1 tsp vanilla
- 2 handfuls baby spinach
- 2 cups ice cubes

## Utilities

- High speed blender

## Intructions

1. Add dates to the high speed blender with some water. You want to get them
   broken down to as close of a paste as you can or else you will have small
   pieces in the smoothie.
2. Combine the rest of the ingredients in the blender and blend until smooth
   and desired consistency.
