## Ingredients

- 2 cans tuna (5oz cans)
- 1 tbsp of the liquid from the tuna can
- 1/2 cup almond flour
- 2 tbsp chopped parsley
- 1 tsp lemon zest
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 2 tbsp grated red onion
- 2 stalks celery, chopped
- 2 dill pickles, chopped (optional)
- 1/4 cup chopped scallions
- 1 1/2 tsp dijon mustard or mustard powder

- 1/2 tsp pepper
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp olive oil

## Utilities

- Skillet

## Intructions

1. Drain the liquid from the cans of tuna, reserving 1 tbsp of the liquid from
   the can. Add the tuna and reserved liquid to a bowl and break the tuna up
   with a fork. 
2. Add in the almond flour, chopped parsley, lemon juice and zest, red onion,
   scallions, mustard, egg, salt and pepper. Stir until well mixed and then
   taste. Adjust the seasoning as desired. 
3. Form the mixture into 6 patties and place on a parchment paper lined plate
   or tray. Place the patties in the fridge for a minimum of 20 minutes,
   chilling them will help them hold together when cooking. 
4. When ready to cook, place the olive oil in cast iron skillet on medium heat.
   Once hot add in the patties and let them cook for approximately 4 minutes
   until a golden crust forms. Flip and cook on the other side. 
5. Serve the patties with lemon wedges and roasted red pepper sauce or lemon
   aioli.
