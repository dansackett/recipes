| 10 Minutes | 25 Minutes |

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 pounds chicken breasts
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon sea salt, plus more to season the chicken
- 4 tablespoons avocado oil
- 2 green apples
- 1 onion
- 4 zucchinis
- 1 tablespoon cassava flour, optional
- 4 teaspoons dried sage

## Intructions

1. Season chicken generously with garlic powder and sea salt. Cook in half of the oil over medium-high heat until nice and golden on each side, but not quite cooked through.
2. Peel the apple and onion. Chop par-cooked chicken breast, zucchini, apple and onion into half-inch cubes.
3. Add remaining oil to the uncleaned chicken pan over medium heat.
4. Add onion and cook until soft (about 10-15 minutes).
5. In a large bowl, mix together cassava flour, sage and salt. Add cubed zucchinis and apples to the bowl and toss to incorporate.
6. When the onions are softened, add zucchini/apple/spice mixture and cook uncovered for about 10 minutes, or until apples begin to soften.
7. Return cubed chicken to pan and cook until no pink remains in the chicken.
