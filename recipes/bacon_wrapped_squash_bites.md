# Bacon Wrapped Butternut Squash Bites

This is an easy appetizer or side. I made them for Thanksgiving before (hence
the sage) but they're good in any occasion.

## Timing

| Prep Time  | Cook Time  |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| 15 Minutes | 30 Minutes |

## Ingredients

- 2 1/2 cups diced butternut squash (1" cubes)
- 1 pack bacon (11 slices)
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1 tbsp chopped fresh sage

## Utilities

- Cookie baking sheet

## Intructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Mix the cubes of butternut squash in a big bowl with olive oil, salt and cinnamon.
3. Place in the fridge for 1 hour.
4. Prepare your bacon while the squash is marinating.
5. Cut your bacon slices in half (NOT length wise but across in the middle).
6. Take your butternut squash out of the fridge.
7. Have your baking sheet ready, no need to oil.
8. Wrap each little dice of butternut squash in a piece of bacon.
9. Repeat until you are out of bacon and place the rolls on your baking sheet.
10. Sprinkle your sage on top for the garnish.
11. Bake for 30 minutes or until the bacon becomes brown and crispy.

## Notes

Make sure you place the bacon roll with the end of the bacon facing down on the
baking sheet. It will keep the roll in place while roasting in the oven.
