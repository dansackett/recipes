| 45 Minutes | 30 Minutes |

## Ingredients

- 1 spaghetti squash
- 3 carrots
- 1 onion
- 2 stalks celery
- 6 ounces mushrooms
- 1 bunch kale
- 1 pound ground pork
- 1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
- 14 ounces full fat coconut milk
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon sea salt, to taste 

## Intructions

1. Preheat oven to 375F.
2. In a shallow, non-reactive baking dish, roast squash for 30-45 minutes, or until squash can be punctured with a fork. When cool enough to handle, slice in half and scrape out the squash strands. Squash can be cooked ahead of time and refrigerated until ready to use.
3. Meanwhile, chop carrots, onion, celery, mushrooms, and kale.
4. In a skillet, brown ground pork and set aside.
5. In a separate pan, warm oil. Add onions, carrots, and celery and saute for 6-7 minutes, until beginning to soften. Stir in mushrooms and cook for another 2-3 minutes.
6. Add ground pork back to the pan. Stir in coconut milk, oregano, garlic powder, and salt. Simmer for 6-8 minutes.
7. Place spaghetti squash strands in a baking dish. Pour meat sauce over the squash, add chopped kale, and stir to combine. Bake for 40-45 minutes.
8. Remove from oven and let casserole set for 5-10 minutes before serving.
