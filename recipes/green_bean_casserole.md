## Intructions

### For the cream of mushroom soup

1. Using a medium stock pot, melt the coconut oil on medium heat. Saute the
   mushroom and garlic for 4-5 minutes or until tender.
2. Pour in the remainder of the ingredients, mix well to combine and bring to a
   simmer for about 10 minutes or until the soup thickens.
3. Remove from heat and allow to cool before using an immersion blender or
   high-speed blender to fully blend the soup. Set aside.

### For the green bean casserole

1. Fill a large stock pot about two-thirds of the way full and bring to a boil.
   Add the green beans and cook for 10 minutes or until fork tender. Strain and
   set aside.
2. Preheat the oven to 400 F and prepare a large casserole dish. Combine the
   green beans and mushroom soup.
3. Bake the casserole in the preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, while
   simultaneously cooking the fried onions (see below). Once the casserole is
   fully cooked, top with the fried onions and serve.

### For the fried onions

1. Combined the two flours, salt, and pepper in a bowl and set aside. Set up a
   station with the bowl of flour, and another bowl with the coconut milk.
2. Using a large deep skillet, melt the coconut oil and bring to a high heat.
   The oil has to be very hot to properly fry!
3. Begin coating the onions by dipping them in the coconut milk, and then the
   flour mixture. Carefully drop in the onions and cook for about 2 minutes of
   each side before setting aside. Youâ€™ll fry all of the onions in about 3-4
   small batches. Add more coconut oil if needed.
