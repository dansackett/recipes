## Intructions

1. For the salsa, combine all ingredients in a bowl and marinate in the fridge for at least 30 minutes.
2. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
3. Combine the meat and salt by hand and form into four balls, then flatten into 1/4-inch thick patties.
4. Place half of the salsa on one of the patties and lay another patty on top. Seal the edges by hand, making one large, fat burger. Repeat for the remaining patties and salsa.
