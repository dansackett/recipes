| 10 Minutes | 60 Minutes |

## Ingredients

- 4 small/med very overripe bananas or 3 larger ones, mashed well
- 4 large eggs room temp
- 2 tsp pure vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup coconut oil melted and cooled to almost room temp
- 1 3/4 cups blanched almond flour
- 1/2 cup tapioca flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp fine grain sea salt
- 1 tbsp coconut sugar

## Utilities

- Two glass bowls
- Bread pan (I use a silicone one)

## Intructions

> Fun fact! if your bananas are not ripe yet or you would like them extra brown
> for better taste, heat your oven to 300 degrees and place bananas on a
> backing sheet covered with aluminum foil. Bake bananas in the peel for 30
> minutes or until the color you wish. They will come out with brown peels and
> super gooey inside.

1.  Whisk together all dry ingredients and set aside. Preheat your oven to 350
    degrees F and line a medium loaf pan with parchment paper.
2.  In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and mashed bananas, then vanilla
    and coconut oil until well combined.
3.  Slowly stir the dry mixture into the wet (donâ€™t use an electric mixer - you
    will overmix the batter and prevent it from rising properly) just until
    moistened and no visible flour remains.
4.  Transfer batter to prepared loaf pan and bake in the preheated oven for
    50-60 minutes until deep golden brown and toothpick inserted into the
    center of the loaf comes out clean. Allow to cool completely in the loaf
    pan resting on a wire rack, then remove using the parchment paper to help
    you, slice and serve.
