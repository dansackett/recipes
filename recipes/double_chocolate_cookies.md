| 20 minutes | 10 minutes |

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips
- 2 tbsp ghee
- 3/4 cup sifted fine-ground almond flour
- 1/2 cup coconut sugar
- 1/4 cup packed cacao powder
- 1/2 tsp baking soda
- 1/4 tsp fine-grain sea salt
- 2 large eggs, room temperature
- 1 tsp vanilla extract

## Utilities

- Baking sheet
- Small sauce pan
- Small glass mixing bowl
- Medium glass mixing bowl

## Intructions

1. Melt 1 cup of chocolate chips and ghee in a double boiler over low heat set
   over a sauce pan of gently simmering water. Stir frequently using a rubber
   spatula until completely melted and combined. Remove from the heat and let
   cool for about 5-7 minutes or until the bowl is cool to the touch.
2. Meanwhile put almond flour, coconut sugar, cacao powder, baking soda, and
   salt in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Stir together with a fork.
3. Use a rubber spatula to mix the eggs and vanilla into the cooled chocolate.
   Then use the spatula to scrape the chocolate into the flour mixture. Mix
   with a hand mixer on low speed until it is well combined. The dough should
   be cool enough to add the remaining 1/2 cup of dark chocolate chips. Fold
   them into the dough with the spatula.
4. Chill the dough uncovered in the freezer for 10-15 minutes or until firm.
   While the dough is chilling, preheat ovem to 350 degrees. Line a baking
   sheet with parchment paper and grab dough.
5. Get about 1-inch balls from the dough and place them on the baking sheet.
6. Bake for 10 minutes and move cookies to a cooling rack. Repeat until all
   dough has been used.
