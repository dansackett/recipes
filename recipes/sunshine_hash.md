## Ingredients

- 8 slices bacon
- 1 parsnip
- 1 golden beet, or an extra parsnip
- 1 sweet potato
- 1 green apple
- 1 head broccoli
- 1/2 lemon
- 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
- sea salt, to taste 

## Instructions

1. Chop the bacon into bite-sized pieces.
2. Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped bacon and cook until it has reached its desired crispness. Stir frequently. Once it is cooked, transfer the bacon to a paper towel lined plate, reserving fat in the pan.
3. Peel and chop the parsnip, beet, and sweet potato. Chop up the apple. Mince the broccoli florets and set aside. Juice and zest the lemon.
4. Add chopped parsnip, beet and sweet potato to the hot bacon grease in the pan. Cook 15-20 minutes until vegetables begin to soften.
5. Add the chopped apple. Continue cooking, stirring often, until sweet potatoes are fork tender. Finally, stir in the broccoli and cooked bacon.
6. Sprinkle in garlic powder. Season with lemon and sea salt.
7. Cook just until the broccoli is a vibrant green. Remove from heat and serve immediately.
