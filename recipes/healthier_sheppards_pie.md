## Ingredients

- 1 head cauliflower
- 1 onion
- 2 carrots
- 6 tablespoons coconut oil
- 1 teaspoon coarse sea salt, plus more to taste
- 1 cup beef broth
- 1 1/2 tablespoons arrowroot
- 3 tablespoons water
- 1 pound ground lamb

## Intructions

1. Preheat oven to 350F. Break cauliflower into florets. Dice onions and carrots.
2. In a large saucepan, cover cauliflower with water and boil until tender.
3. Drain and transfer to a food processor with 2/3 of the oil. Process until cauliflower is smooth. Season with salt to taste and set aside.
4. Meanwhile, heat the beef broth in a small saucepan until hot.
5. Mix the arrowroot powder and water together and slowly pour the mixture into the saucepan of hot broth over low heat. Stir gently until broth thickens into a gravy.
6. Saut√© onions and carrots with remaining oil until they begin to soften. Add the ground lamb to brown, breaking apart into small pieces with a wooden spoon.
7. Pour gravy over meat mixture. Season with salt to taste.
8. Transfer the meat mixture into a shallow 2-quart casserole dish. Spoon the cauliflower mash over the meat and spread evenly. If you'd like to freeze the pie, do so now by covering the dish with a layer of parchment paper, tightly covering with foil, and placing in the freezer.
9. If cooking now, bake uncovered for 30 minutes, or until the top is lightly browned.
10. To cook from frozen, remove from the freezer and allow to defrost on the counter for 1 hour. Remove foil and parchment, and place in a cold oven. Set the temperature to 350F and allow to bake for 45-60 minutes or until hot through the center and lightly browned.
