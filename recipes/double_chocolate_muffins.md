## Intructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. In a large mixing bowl, whisk eggs. Add all ingredients to bowl and mix with
   a hand mixer until it forms a thick brownie batter consistency.
3. Fold chocolate chips in.
4. Use an icecream scoop to scoop batter into muffin liners in muffin tin.
   These muffins don't rise like traditional muffins so it's OK to fill them
   more than normal.
