# Salmon and Hollandaise Sauce

Salmon is a stunner and when you do the Hollandaise sauce right it's a killer.
Hollandaise or double broiler cooking is a skill I'm glad I learned. I like to
serve with a side of asparagus cooked in the oven.

## Timing

| Prep Time  | Cook Time  |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| 10 Minutes | 30 Hours |

## Ingredients

- 1/2 lbs salmon fillet
- 1/4 tsp sea salt
- 1/8 tsp ground black pepper
- 1 lemon
- 1/4 orange
- 2 eggs
- 4 ounces coconut oil
- cayenne pepper, to taste

## Utilities

- Small baking dish
- Small glass mixing bowl
- Sauce pan

## Intructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
2. Season salmon with salt and pepper on both sides.
3. Slice 3/4 of the lemon into thin rounds. Add rounds to the bottom of the
   baking pan such that the salmon lays on a bed of lemon slices. Use
   additional slices on top of salmon.
4. Place in over and bake for 12-15 minutes or until it reaches an internal
   temperature of 145 degrees. It should be flaky throughout.
5. While it's cooking, get the mixing bowl and separate two egg yolks. You can
   save or discard the egg whites. Squeeze the orange juice and the rest of the
   lemon juice into the bowl. Melt coconut oil and add whisking quickly so the
   eggs don't cook and clump up.
6. Boil a small amount of water in a sauce pan and place the mixing bowl with
   eggs and citrus over the sauce pan. The steam from the boiling water should
   cook the liquid. Whisk quickly and often until sauce gets a creamy
   consistency. It should not be runny or liquid-like. Add the cayenne pepper
   to the sauce to your liking.
7. Serve the salmon with hollandaise drizzled over top. If serving with
   asparagus, put sauce over that too!
