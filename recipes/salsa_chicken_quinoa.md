## Ingredients

**Main dish**

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 small onion, chopped
- 1 large or 2 small bell peppers, chopped
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 1/2 cups shredded or chopped cooked chicken
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 1 cup uncooked quinoa, rinsed
- 1 (14 ounce) can black beans, drained and rinsed
- 1 cup corn (fresh or frozen works)
- 1 cup mild or medium salsa (or hot, if you want!)
- 2 cups chicken stock
- 1 cup freshly grated

**Avocado pico**

- 2 avocados, cubed
- 1/2 cup diced tomatoes
- 1/4 cup diced red onion
- 1/2 cup chopped cilantro
- 2 limes, freshly juiced
- salt and pepper

## Intructions

1. Heat the olive oil in large skillet over medium-low heat. Add in the onion, peppers, and garlic with a bit pinch of salt and pepper and stir. Cook for about 5 minutes, until the vegetables have softened. Stir in the shredded chicken. Add in the paprika, chili powder and cumin with one more pinch of salt and pepper. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes to activate the spices.
2. Add the quinoa, beans, corn, salsa and chicken stock. Bring the mixture to a boil then reduce it to a simmer and cover it. Cook for 15 minutes, then remove the lid and stir. If the liquid hasnâ€™t fully absorbed yet, continue to cook for another 5 minutes.
3. Serve the quinoa and top with the avocado pico, such as sour cream or yogurt, green onions, lime and cotija cheese.  Spritz with a wedge of lime. Leftovers stay great in the fridge!

**Avocado pico de gallo**

1. Combine everything in a bowl and season with salt and pepper.  This stays okay sealed in the fridge overnight, but the avocado will brown a bit. To serve, make it right before eating.
