| 15 Minutes | 15 Minutes |

## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups panko breadcrumbs
- Oil spray
- 1 egg
- 1 tbsp mayonnaise
- 1 1/2 tbsp dijon mustard (or other mustard)
- 2 tbsp flour
- 1/2 tsp salt
- Black pepper
- 1 lbs chicken tenderloins

## Intructions

1. Preheat oven to 200C/390F.
2. Spread panko on a baking tray, spray with oil (spray vertically to avoid blowing the panko off the tray), then bake for 3 to 5 minutes until light golden. Transfer to bowl.
3. Place a rack on a baking tray (not critical but bakes more evenly).
4. Place the Batter ingredients in a bowl and whisk with a fork until combined.
5. Add the chicken into the Batter and toss to coat.
6. Pick up chicken with tongs and place it into the panko bowl.
7. Sprinkle surface with breadcrumbs, then press down to adhere. Transfer onto baking tray. Marvel at clean fingers, repeat with remaining chicken.
8. Spray lightly with oil, sprinkle with a touch of salt (optional).
9. Bake 15 minutes (medium) or up to 20 minutes if gigantic. Any longer = dried out chicken.
10. Remove from oven and serve immediately, with Sauce of choice (Honey Mustard pictured, see Note 2) and sprinkled with fresh parsley, if desired.
