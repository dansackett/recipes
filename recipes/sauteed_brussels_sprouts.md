# Sauteed Brussels Sprouts with Bacon, Capers, and Lemon Zest

These are an excellent side! They have a ton of flavor and dress of a normally
boring Brussels Sprout (I love these things personally).

## Timing

| Prep Time  | Cook Time  |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| 15 Minutes | 20 Minutes |

## Ingredients

- 1 bushel of Brussels Sprouts
- 4 slices of bacon, diced
- 1 tbsp capers
- 3 cloves garlic, diced
- Zest of 2 lemons
- 2 tsp sea salt

## Utilities

- Deep skillet

## Intructions

1. Cut the bottoms off of the Brussels sprouts and peel the outer leaves off
   the sprouts. Cut each sprout into quarters. (Alternately, to save work, cut
   the bottoms off the sprouts, peel of the outer leaves, and pulse the sprouts
   a few times in a food processor to coarsely shred them.)
2. Add the diced bacon to a skillet. Place the skillet on a burner over
   medium-high heat and cook the bacon, stirring occasionally, until it is deep
   red and crispy and most of the fat has been rendered out. Add the Brussels
   sprouts and remaining ingredients to the skillet.
3. Cook the sprouts, stirring often, until they are browning, crisping, and
   fragrant. When fully cooked the sprouts should be soft and easily pierced
   with a fork.
4. Serve topped with cracked black pepper and additional lemon zest if desired
   (optional). Enjoy!
