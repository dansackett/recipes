## Ingredients

- 1 onion
- 1 1/2 pounds ground beef
- 1 teaspoon minced garlic
- 2 teaspoons coarse sea salt
- 4 cups beef broth, or chicken broth
- 2 teaspoons dried thyme
- 2 tablespoons coconut oil
- 8 ounces sliced cremini mushrooms
- 1 1/2 teaspoons arrowroot
- 2 teaspoons water

## Intructions

1. Finely mince onion.
2. In a large mixing bowl, add ground beef, garlic, and 1/2 of the onion. Stir to combine. Fold in 1/2 of the salt. Mix until well combined.
3. Form the meat mixture into patties and set aside while you prepare the sauce.
4. Bring broth, thyme, and remaining salt to full boil over medium-high heat. Reduce to medium heat and keep at a gentle boil until sauce is reduced by half. While sauce reduces, prepare steaks.
5. Melt half the oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Cook the remaining onions until they begin to soften.
6. Remove the onions, add the mushrooms, and continue sauteing the mushrooms until soft. Remove and set aside.
7. Melt remaining oil in the skillet and add the patties, searing on both sides until nice and brown on the outside but still pink in the center.
8. In a small bowl, mix the arrowroot powder and filtered water and incorporate into the sauce, then remove sauce from heat.
9. Smother the patties with saut√©ed mushrooms and onions. Top with the sauce. Continue to simmer over a moderately low flame until the steaks are cooked through.
